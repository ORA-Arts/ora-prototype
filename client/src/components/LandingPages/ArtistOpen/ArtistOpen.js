                <p>In many ways, artists create prisms. Through their work, they each share with us their singular
                    outlook on
                    our world, thereby stimulating our own imagination and in turn uniting us around collective
                    representations.
                    ​In the globalised and interconnected era in which we find ourselves, we are more than ever aware of
                    the
                    plurality of these perspectives. Almost paradoxically, our increased access to these myriad cultural
                    productions also reminds us of the universality of human experience, however multifaceted it may be.
                    ORA’ support to production and diffusion aims to embody our contemporary era to every creative
                    medium,
                    beyond visual arts : creators of all ages, career brackets, and geographies are welcome to apply to
                    our open
                    call. Creators are welcome to submit ambitious ideas and to discuss them with our team.

                    <p> Once selected, ORA’s teams provide artists with the means to produce, finance and exhibit their
                        projects. Each artist is paired with a curator allowing for the preparation of the project’s
                        diffusion throughout several institutional exhibition spaces. While being exhibited, the
                        artworks produced are sold on our platform ensuring a fair revenue for the artist. ORA also
                        implements a cooperative system: a part of the profits are reinjected in the production capital
                        fund enabling future projects to take shape. <br><br> Once a project concludes, our ambition is
                        to contribute to bridging the gap which currently exists between actors of the art market and
                        many contemporary artists, whether early, mid or late career by introducing them to our network
                        of partner galleries. <br><br> The submission platform will open shortly. Meanwhile, if you have
                        an idea you would like to discuss with our team you can get in touch with us ! </p>
